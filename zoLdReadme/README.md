# Step 1: Install dependencies
```
npm install @apollo/server graphql
```

# Set up with JavaScript
```
touch index.js
```

# Package.json in Javascript 
```
{
  // ...etc.
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
  // other dependencies
}
```
# Define your GraphQL schema
```
import { ApolloServer } from '@apollo/server';
import { startStandaloneServer } from '@apollo/server/standalone';

// A schema is a collection of type definitions (hence "typeDefs")
// that together define the "shape" of queries that are executed against
// your data.
const typeDefs = `#graphql
  # Comments in GraphQL strings (such as this one) start with the hash (#) symbol.

  # This "Book" type defines the queryable fields for every book in our data source.
  type Book {
    title: String
    author: String
  }

  # The "Query" type is special: it lists all of the available queries that
  # clients can execute, along with the return type for each. In this
  # case, the "books" query returns an array of zero or more Books (defined above).
  type Query {
    books: [Book]
  }
`;
```

# Define a resolver
```
// Resolvers define how to fetch the types defined in your schema.
// This resolver retrieves books from the "books" array above.
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
  },
};
```

# Create an instance of ApolloServer
```
// The ApolloServer constructor requires two parameters: your schema
// definition and your set of resolvers.
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

// Passing an ApolloServer instance to the `startStandaloneServer` function:
//  1. creates an Express app
//  2. installs your ApolloServer instance as middleware
//  3. prepares your app to handle incoming requests
const { url } = await startStandaloneServer(server, {
  listen: { port: 4000 },
});

console.log(`🚀  Server ready at: ${url}`);
```
# Start the server
```
npm start
```
You should now see the following output at the bottom of your terminal:
```
🚀  Server ready at: http://localhost:4000/
```
